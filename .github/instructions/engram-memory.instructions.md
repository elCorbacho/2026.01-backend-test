description: Memory Protocol Full Text
The Memory Protocol teaches agents when and how to use Engram's MCP tools. Without it, the agent has the tools but no behavioral guidance. Add this to your agent's prompt file (see README for per-agent locations).

WHEN TO SAVE (mandatory — not optional)
Call mem_save IMMEDIATELY after any of these:

Bug fix completed
Architecture or design decision made
Non-obvious discovery about the codebase
Configuration change or environment setup
Pattern established (naming, structure, convention)
User preference or constraint learned
Format for mem_save:

title: Verb + what — short, searchable (e.g. "Fixed N+1 query in UserList", "Chose Zustand over Redux")
type: bugfix | decision | architecture | discovery | pattern | config | preference
scope: project (default) | personal
topic_key (optional, recommended for evolving decisions): stable key like architecture/auth-model
content:
**What**: One sentence — what was done
**Why**: What motivated it (user request, bug, performance, etc.)
**Where**: Files or paths affected
**Learned**: Gotchas, edge cases, things that surprised you (omit if none)
Topic update rules (mandatory)
Different topics must not overwrite each other (e.g. architecture vs bugfix)
Reuse the same topic_key to update an evolving topic instead of creating new observations
If unsure about the key, call mem_suggest_topic_key first and then reuse it
Use mem_update when you have an exact observation ID to correct
WHEN TO SEARCH MEMORY
When the user asks to recall something — any variation of "remember", "recall", "what did we do", "how did we solve", "recordar", "acordate", "qué hicimos", or references to past work:

First call mem_context — checks recent session history (fast, cheap)
If not found, call mem_search with relevant keywords (FTS5 full-text search)
If you find a match, use mem_get_observation for full untruncated content
Also search memory PROACTIVELY when:

Starting work on something that might have been done before
The user mentions a topic you have no context on — check if past sessions covered it
SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL (mandatory)
Before ending a session or saying "done" / "listo" / "that's it", you MUST call mem_session_summary with this structure:

## Goal
[What we were working on this session]

## Instructions
[User preferences or constraints discovered — skip if none]

## Discoveries
- [Technical findings, gotchas, non-obvious learnings]

## Accomplished
- [Completed items with key details]

## Next Steps
- [What remains to be done — for the next session]

## Relevant Files
- path/to/file — [what it does or what changed]
This is NOT optional. If you skip this, the next session starts blind.

PASSIVE CAPTURE — automatic learning extraction
When completing a task or subtask, include a ## Key Learnings: section at the end of your response with numbered items. Engram will automatically extract and save these as observations.

Example:

## Key Learnings:

1. bcrypt cost=12 is the right balance for our server performance
2. JWT refresh tokens need atomic rotation to prevent race conditions
You can also call mem_capture_passive(content) directly with any text that contains a learning section. This is a safety net — it captures knowledge even if you forget to call mem_save explicitly.

AFTER COMPACTION
If you see a message about compaction or context reset, or if you see "FIRST ACTION REQUIRED" in your context:

IMMEDIATELY call mem_session_summary with the compacted summary content — this persists what was done before compaction
Then call mem_context to recover any additional context from previous sessions
Only THEN continue working
Do not skip step 1. Without it, everything done before compaction is lost from memory.

## Memory
You have access to Engram persistent memory via MCP tools (mem_save, mem_search, mem_session_summary, etc.).
- Save proactively after significant work — don't wait to be asked.
- After any compaction or context reset, call `mem_context` to recover session state before continuing.
