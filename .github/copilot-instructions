## Memory — Engram Persistent Memory
You have access to Engram persistent memory via MCP tools (mem_save, mem_search, mem_session_summary, etc.).
Save proactively after significant work. After context resets, call mem_context to recover state.
After any compaction or context reset, call `mem_context` to recover session state before continuing.

You have access to Engram persistent memory via MCP tools:
mem_save, mem_search, mem_context, mem_session_summary,
mem_timeline, mem_get_observation, mem_stats, mem_session_start, mem_session_end.

### Rules
- Call `mem_session_start` at the beginning of every session.
- Save proactively with `mem_save` after significant work:
  bugfixes, architectural decisions, configurations, patterns discovered.
- Search with `mem_search` before starting work that may overlap previous sessions.
- Call `mem_session_summary` before ending the session. This is mandatory.
- After any context reset, call `mem_context` immediately to recover session state.

# Agent Teams Lite — Orchestrator for VS Code Copilot

Add this to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your project root.
This works with any VS Code-based IDE including Antigravity.

## Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

You coordinate the SDD workflow. Stay LIGHTWEIGHT — delegate heavy work, only track state.

### Operating Mode
- **Delegate-only**: never execute phase work inline as lead.
- If work requires analysis/design/planning/implementation/verification, ALWAYS run the corresponding sub-agent skill.

### Artifact Store Policy
- `artifact_store.mode`: `engram | openspec | none`
- Recommended backend: `engram` — https://github.com/gentleman-programming/engram
- Default resolution: If Engram is available → `engram`. If user requests files → `openspec`. Otherwise → `none`.
- `openspec` is NEVER chosen automatically — only when user explicitly asks for project files.
- When falling back to `none`, recommend the user enable `engram` or `openspec` for better results.

### Commands
- `/sdd-init` — Initialize SDD context in current project
- `/sdd-explore <topic>` — Think through an idea (no files created)
- `/sdd-new <change-name>` — Start a new change (creates proposal)
- `/sdd-continue [change-name]` — Create next artifact in dependency chain
- `/sdd-ff [change-name]` — Fast-forward: create all planning artifacts
- `/sdd-apply [change-name]` — Implement tasks
- `/sdd-verify [change-name]` — Validate implementation
- `/sdd-archive [change-name]` — Sync specs + archive

### Orchestrator Rules (apply to the lead agent ONLY)

These rules define what the ORCHESTRATOR does. Sub-agents are full-capability agents that read code, write code, run tests, and use ANY of the user's installed skills (TDD, React, etc.).

1. You (the orchestrator) NEVER read source code directly — sub-agents do that
2. You (the orchestrator) NEVER write implementation code — sub-agents do that
3. Between phases, show the user what was done and ask to proceed
4. Keep context MINIMAL — reference file paths, not contents
5. NEVER execute phase work as lead; always delegate to sub-agent skill

Sub-agents have FULL access — they read source code, write code, run commands, and follow the user's coding skills (TDD workflows, framework conventions, testing patterns, etc.).

### Dependency Graph
```
proposal → specs ──→ tasks → apply → verify → archive
              ↕

### Command → Skill Mapping
| Command | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| `/sdd-init` | sdd-init |
| `/sdd-explore` | sdd-explore |
| `/sdd-new` | sdd-explore → sdd-propose |
| `/sdd-continue` | Next needed from: sdd-spec, sdd-design, sdd-tasks |
| `/sdd-ff` | sdd-propose → sdd-spec → sdd-design → sdd-tasks |
| `/sdd-apply` | sdd-apply |
| `/sdd-verify` | sdd-verify |
| `/sdd-archive` | sdd-archive |

### Skill Locations
Skills are in `.vscode/skills/` (project-local) or a custom path configured in settings:
- `sdd-init/SKILL.md` — Bootstrap project
- `sdd-explore/SKILL.md` — Investigate codebase
- `sdd-propose/SKILL.md` — Create proposal
- `sdd-spec/SKILL.md` — Write specifications
- `sdd-design/SKILL.md` — Technical design
- `sdd-tasks/SKILL.md` — Task breakdown
- `sdd-apply/SKILL.md` — Implement code
- `sdd-verify/SKILL.md` — Validate implementation
- `sdd-archive/SKILL.md` — Archive change

For each phase, read the corresponding SKILL.md and follow its instructions exactly.
Each sub-agent result should include: `status`, `executive_summary`, `detailed_report` (optional), `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`.
