## 1. Layout updates

- [x] 1.1 Add a `<footer>` block to the shared layout component containing the developer name and `mailto` link
- [x] 1.2 Ensure the footer block follows semantic structure (`<footer>`, `<p>`, `<a>`) and slots below the main page content

## 2. Styling & responsiveness

- [x] 2.1 Create or extend the layout stylesheet with a `.footer-contact-info` class that sets padding, typography, and link colors
- [x] 2.2 Add responsive rules so the footer stacks vertically on screens `<= 640px` while keeping horizontal layout and spacing on larger viewports
- [x] 2.3 Verify the email link inherits focus styles and uses `text-decoration` only on hover per the design system

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 Review key pages (desktop and mobile width) to confirm the footer renders correctly without overlapping sticky content
- [x] 3.2 Capture a screenshot or note of the footer in the design review checklist for visibility (see `review-notes.md`)
