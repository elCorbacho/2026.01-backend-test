## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Static page head declares UTF-8 and Spanish Chilean locale
Static HTML pages that sirven desde `/index.html` and rutas estáticas relacionadas SHALL include both a `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, an explicit `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />`, and a `Content-Language: es-CL` declaration so browsers know the document is Spanish (Chile) before rendering text.

#### Scenario: Browser fetches the landing page
- **WHEN** any user agent requests `/`
- **THEN** the returned HTML contains `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, the additional `Content-Type` meta, and the `<html lang="es-CL">` attribute with `Content-Language: es-CL` in headers.

### Requirement: All HTTP responses send charset=UTF-8 by default
All responses generated by Spring Boot, including resources under `/static/`, SHALL set `Content-Type` headers that include `charset=UTF-8` so the client never interprets UTF-8 bytes as Latin-1.

#### Scenario: Curl fetches `/index.html`
- **WHEN** a curl client issues `curl -I http://localhost:8080/
- **THEN** the `Content-Type` header explicitly contains `charset=UTF-8` (e.g., `text/html;charset=UTF-8`).

### Requirement: Common Spanish text remains readable
Phrases that include Spanish accents (e.g., "Enlaces útiles", "Guía", "Recursos") SHALL be stored using real accented letters so they render correctly when the encoding is honored.

#### Scenario: QA inspects the "Recursos" section
- **WHEN** the QA team opens the section over HTTPS
- **THEN** the heading reads `Enlaces útiles` with a lowercase accent, and the copy contains the correct accented words (e.g., "Guía") instead of their corrupted counterparts.
