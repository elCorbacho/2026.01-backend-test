# Console Log Encoding and Format Specification

## Purpose

Define the expected behavior to eliminate malformed symbols in terminal logs and provide a clear, readable console format for application, HTTP, and SQL messages.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Remove mojibake from console logs

The system MUST avoid malformed symbols (e.g., `ÔûÂ`, `Ôöé`) in console output generated by logging patterns.

#### Scenario: HTTP and SQL logs render without malformed symbols

- GIVEN the application is running and emitting HTTP/SQL logs
- WHEN logs are printed in the local terminal
- THEN output SHALL not contain mojibake artifacts such as `ÔûÂ` or `Ôöé`

### Requirement: Keep logs readable and structured

The system MUST output logs in a clear structure including timestamp, level/category, and message content.

#### Scenario: Structured line format

- GIVEN a new log entry is emitted
- WHEN the line is rendered in console
- THEN the line SHALL include a readable timestamp and message classification
- AND the message text SHALL be understandable without special glyph support

### Requirement: Preserve category distinction for app/HTTP/SQL logs

The logging configuration SHOULD keep visual distinction between general app logs, HTTP request logs, and SQL logs.

#### Scenario: Category prefixes remain clear

- GIVEN app, HTTP, and SQL events are logged
- WHEN viewed in console
- THEN each category SHOULD be identifiable by stable textual prefixes/patterns

### Requirement: Terminal compatibility for local development

The logging output MUST remain legible in common local terminal environments used by the project (PowerShell/CMD), even when full Unicode icon rendering is not available.

#### Scenario: Local terminal fallback compatibility

- GIVEN terminal encoding/font support is limited
- WHEN logs are emitted
- THEN output SHALL still be readable using encoding-safe characters

### Requirement: Do not alter functional application behavior

Changes to log formatting MUST NOT modify API behavior, business logic, or persistence behavior.

#### Scenario: Functional behavior unaffected

- GIVEN the logging configuration is updated
- WHEN application tests/build are executed
- THEN tests SHALL still pass
- AND no functional endpoint behavior shall be changed by this logging-only change
